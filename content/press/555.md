**Taraxacum officinale** is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant of the family Asteraceae (Compositae). Commonly known as the dandelion, it can be found growing in temperate regions of the world, in lawns, on roadsides, on disturbed banks and shores of waterways, and other areas with moist soils. 

Although widely considered a weed, especially in lawns and along roadsides, it is sometimes used as a medical herb and in food preparation. The species is well known for its yellow flower heads that turn into round balls of silver tufted fruits that disperse in the wind.
