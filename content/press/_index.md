  description: Quick music plays in the background, competing with the persistent
    thrum of fans. Water marks on the ceiling give away the building's age, and green
    and red decorative stars hang from the ceiling. A church basement may not an ideal
    dance studio, but it has a spacious dance floor. And space is desperately needed.
    The dancers rehearse only a sliver of their repertoire, but before the night is
    over, they complete three different lifts. One of those had the dancers' pointed
    toes hovering at least three feet above the ground, as if they aimed to imitate
    the height of mountains for which the group is named.

**Banksia aculeata**, the prickly banksia, is a plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A bushy shrub up to 2 m (7 ft) tall, it has fissured grey bark on its trunk and branches, and dense foliage and leaves with very prickly serrated margins.

Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Unlike many other banksia species, it does not have a woody base, or lignotuber. Although it was collected in the 1840s by the naturalist James Drummond, it was not formally described until 1981, in Alex George's monograph of the genus.
