  description: Quick music plays in the background, competing with the persistent
    thrum of fans. Water marks on the ceiling give away the building's age, and green
    and red decorative stars hang from the ceiling. A church basement may not an ideal
    dance studio, but it has a spacious dance floor. And space is desperately needed.
    The dancers rehearse only a sliver of their repertoire, but before the night is
    over, they complete three different lifts. One of those had the dancers' pointed
    toes hovering at least three feet above the ground, as if they aimed to imitate
    the height of mountains for which the group is named.

**Melodic metalcore** is a fusion genre, incorporating elements of [metalcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore "Metalcore") and [melodic death metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_death_metal "Melodic death metal"), with a heavy emphasis on melodic instrumentation, [blast beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_beat "Blast beat"), metalcore-stylized [breakdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdown_(music) "Breakdown (music)") and clean [singing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing "Singing"). The genre has seen commercial success for employing a "more accessible and commercial style" than typical metalcore.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_metalcore#cite_note-AHM-1)Many notable melodic metalcore bands have been influenced by [At the Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Gates "At the Gates").[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_metalcore#cite_note-:0-2)
