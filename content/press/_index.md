description = "Quick music plays in the background, competing with the persistent thrum of fans. Water marks on the ceiling give away the building's age, and green and red decorative stars hang from the ceiling. A church basement may not an ideal dance studio, but it has a spacious dance floor. And space is desperately needed. The dancers rehearse only a sliver of their repertoire, but before the night is over, they complete three different lifts. One of those had the dancers' pointed toes hovering at least three feet above the ground, as if they aimed to imitate the height of mountains for which the group is named."
