about: Carpathia is Washington's folk dance group that specializes in the dances of
  Central and Eastern Europe. We launched in Spring 2011 with dances from Romania,
  Ukraine, and the Roma (Gypsies). We have since added dances from Poland, Germany,
  Austria, Hungary, Russia, Bulgaria, and Macedonia, with plans to expand to other
  neighboring countries of the region in the coming years.
hireus: For those interested in booking us for a performance, we perform for a modest
  fee (subject to negotiation) which goes towards costumes and rehearsal expenses.
  All inquiries should be sent to carpathiadc@gmail.com.1
